          The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday urged that

        <p class="headline__teaser">
          As expected, Apple today announced its first Arm-based laptops, the
          MacBook Air, Mac mini and Macbook Pro, and, with that, it also
          announced its family of Arm-based Apple Silicon chips. When it first
          announced Apple Silicon, the company didn’t provide a lot of details,
          but in today’s presentation, we learned quite a bit more. The first
          chip in this family is the M1, based on a 5nm process.
